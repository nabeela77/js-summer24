3 scenarios:
1. What happens when useEffect is given the callback & an empty dependency array?
Ans: 1. React renders component, useState is initialized, methods of tick and intervalCb 
     are created, and the initial JSX is generated.
     2. The initial rendering happens and then useeffect runs where the interval is set to each second.
     3. when the component unmounts the interval is cleared.


2. What happens when useEffect is given the callback & the dependency array with the "date" state?
Ans: 1. React renders component, useState is initialized, methods of tick and intervalCb 
     are created, and the initial JSX is generated.
     2. The initial rendering happens and then useeffect runs where the interval is set to each second.
     3. when component mounts due to its dependency on date,  the component rerenders with new date, and the 
     interval is cleared and new interval is formed.


3. What happens when useEffect is given the callback & the dep. array with the intervalCb function?
Ans: 1. React renders component, useState is initialized, methods of tick and intervalCb 
     are created, and the initial JSX is generated.
     2. The initial rendering happens and then useeffect runs where the interval is set to each second.
     3. a new date is formed and then new intervalCb is recreated and on each render useffect runs again.
     4. the interval is cleared.
